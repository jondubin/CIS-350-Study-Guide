** DONE usability and UI
   - Why is usability important?
     - *Therac-25* case study
       - Radiation therapy machine involved in at least 6 accidents
         between 1985-1987
       - patients were give massive overdoses of radiation
       - It moved some safety features from hardware to software
       - Software from the older version (Therac-20) was reused and
         was assumed to be workign correctly
       - *Hamilton, Ontario, July 1985*
         - During treatment, machine stopped and reported "no does"
         - This was a common occurence, so the technician pressed "P"
           to proceed and re-deliver the dose
         - This happened four more times, after which the machine went
           into suspend mode
         - Patient received 5x dose and died four months later
       - In Tyler Texas (1986) a technician reported "Malfunction 54"
         which did not exist in the user manuel
         - the operator had requested 202 units, but only 6 were
           delivered and the patient died five months later
         - the manufacturer could not reproduce this bug so the
           machine was put back into service
         - Malfunction 54 happened again five weeks later and another
           patient died
   - Definition of usability: *Five E's*
     - Effective
     - Efficient
     - Engaging
     - Error Tolerant
     - Easy to learn
   - User-centered design
     - needs, wants, and limitations of end users are given extensive attention
   - Information visualization and metaphors
   - Measuring usability: studies, heuristics, metrics
     - *Heuristics*
       - general guidelines or widely accepted "best practices"
       - Nielsen's usability heuristics
         - Match between system and real world (skeumorphism)
         - Consistency and standards
         - Help and documentation
         - User control and freedom
         - visibility of system status
         - Flexibility and efficiency of use
         - error prevention
         - recognition rather than recall
         - recognize/diagnose erros
         - aesthetic and minimalist design
     - *Usability studies*
       - observe people using the system under normal circumstances
       - methods
         - surveys
         - focus groups
         - ethnography (field observation)
         - observation in controlled setting
     - *Metrics*
       - measure quantitative aspects such as time to complete a task, error rate, memorability, etc.
       - Task analysis
         - *Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)*
           - task is broken down into goals and subgoals
         - *Cognitative Task Analysis (CTA)*
           - also includes cognitative study (time spent thinking about what to do)
     - *Human Reliability Assessment*
       - error rate: how often does the user make a mistake
       - cognitive load: how much can the user keep in his mind during a task?
       - memorability: how much does the user remember?

** DONE integration
   - individual software modules are combined and *tested as a
     group*. occurs after unit testing
   - *Big-bang integration*
     - write everything and hope
     - all components are integrated simultaneously, after which
       everything is tested as a whole
   - *Top-down integration*
     - testing conducted from main module to sub module. If the sub
       module is not developed then it is replaced by a temporary
       program called a stub
   - *Bottom-up integration*
     - lowest level components are tested first.
     - they are then used to facilitate the testing of higher level
       components
** DONE test driven development and defensive programming
   - *Test Driven Development*
     - write test cases *first*
     - then write minimum amount of code to pass the test
     - finally refactor the code to acceptable standards
   - *Defensive Programing*
     - /McConnell, Code Complete, ch. 8/
       - the recognition that programs will have problems and
         modifications, and that a smart programmer will develop code
         accordingly.
       - Protecting program from *invalid inputs*
       - *Error handling*
         - Do nothing: garbage in, garbage out
         - Notify the caller: garbage in, error out
         - Shut it down: garbage in, nothing out
       - *Assertions*
         - code used during development that allows a program to check
           itself as it runs
         - use error-handling code for conditions you expect to occur,
           use assertions for conditions that should never occur
       - *Exceptions*
         - a specific means by which code can pass along errors or
           exceptional events to teh cade that called it
         - try/catch in java
    - /Hunt & Thomas, Pragmatic Programmer, ch. 4/
      - *Design by Contract*
        - documenting the rights and responsibilities of software
          modules to ensure program correctness.
        - *Preconditions*: a routines requirements
        - *Postconditions*: what the routine is guaranteed to do; the
          state of the world when the routine is done
        - *Class invariants*: A class ensures that this condition is
          always true from teh perspective of the caller.
      - Implementing DBC
        - Can partially emulate contracts with *assertions*, but
          assertions don't propogate down an inheritance hierarchy.
        - Some languages have built in support for DBC (like Eiffel)
      - Use exceptions rarely, for unexpected events.
** DONE analyzability (readability, understandability)
   - *Readability*: eas with which reader can identify and
     differentiate tokens and their syntactic meaning
   - *Understandability*: ease with which reader can determine the
     semantic meaning of a piece of code
   - /Boswell, The Art of Readable Code, ch. 2-3/
     - *Packing Information into Names*
       - *choose specific words*. =Size()= vs =Height()=,
         =NumNodes()=, =MemoryBytes()=
       - *Avoid generic names* like =tmp= and =retval=* unless there
         is a reason
       - *Prefer concrete names over abstract names* -
         =ServerCanStart()= vs =CanListenOnPort()=
       - *Attaching extra information to a name*
         - Values with units: =delay= vs =delay_secs=
         - other examples
           - =password= vs =plaintext_password=
           - =html= vs =html_utf8=
       - *Use longer names for larger scopes*
       - *Use capitalization, underscores, etc. in a meaningful way*
     - *The best names* are ones that can't be misconstrued
** DONE concurrency & synchronization
   - Early computers could only run one program at a time
   - *Multi-programming* operating systems (1970s) made it appear as
     if multiple programs were running simultaneously
   - *Instruction-Level Parallelism*
     - rather than wait for an instruction to finish, start the next
       one asap
     - *pipelining*: fetch/decode one instruction while executing another
   - *Thread-Level Parallelism*
     - now we have threads, which allow programs to do more than one
       thing at a time
     - *In Java*
       - each thread has it's own stack and program counter
       - threads in the same process share a heap and static variables
       - Defining and starting a Thread
         #+BEGIN_SRC java
            public class HelloRunnable implements Runnable {

                public void run() {
                    System.out.println("Hello from a thread!");
                }

                public static void main(String args[]) {
                    (new Thread(new HelloRunnable())).start();
                }
            }
          #+END_SRC
       - Threads can make code slower... how?
       - A *Race Condition* occurs when two or more threads can access
         shared data and they try to change it at the same time.
   - *Synchronization*
     - *synchronized methods*
       - in java use the =synchronized= keyword
       - it is not possible for two invocations of synchronized methods
         on the same object to interleave
       - when a synchronized method exits, it establisheds a
         happens-before relationship with any subsequent invocation of a
         synchronized method for the same object. This guarantees that
         the changes to the state of the object are visible to all
         threads.
     - *syncrhonized block*: you don't have to synchronize a whole method
       #+BEGIN_SRC java
       public void add(int value){

           synchronized(this){
               this.count += value;
           }
       }
       #+END_SRC
     - *Lock Objects* are a more sophisticated synchronization method
       #+BEGIN_SRC java
       public class Counter{

           private Lock lock = new Lock();
           private int count = 0;

           public int inc(){
               lock.lock();
               int newCount = ++count;
               lock.unlock();
               return newCount;
           }
       }
       #+END_SRC
     - *Semaphores*
       - A semaphore maintains a set of *permits*.
       - the =acquire()= method blocks until a permit is available and
         then takes it.
       - the =release()= method adds a permit, potentially releasing a
         blocking acquirer
       - semaphores are often used to *restrict* the number of threads
         that can access some resource
** DONE efficiency and performance
   - *Tradeoffs* of code optimization
     - an optimized program can rely on using more elaborate
       algorithms, and may be more difficult to comprehend than an
       unoptimized
     - focusing on optimization (prematurely) can detract from
       achieving other program objectives.
   - *Rules of thumb*
     - use the right algorithm or data structure
     - Measure, don't guess
     - don't unnecessarily create objects
     - don't do unnecessary work
       - for example, reducing the lines of code in a high-level
         language does not improve the speed or size of the resulting
         machine code
   - *Common sources of inefficiency*
     - *I/O operations*: in-memory data structures are much faster and
       should be used unless space is critical.
     - *System Calls* are often expensive.
   - *Lazy evaluation and instantiation*
     - avoids doing work until the work is needed.
   - *Loops*
     - *Unswitching*
       - refers to making a decision inside a loop every time it's
         executed. If the decision doesn't change while the loop is
         executing, put it on the outside of the loop. This involves
         turning the loop inside out and putting loops inside the
         conditional rather than the conditional inside the loop.
     - *Jamming*
       - the result of combining two loops that operate on the same
         set of elements.
     - *Unrolling*
       - reduces the amount of loop housekeeping.
       - to unroll a loop you handle two or more cases in each pass
         through the loop instead of just one.
       - This hurts readability
         #+BEGIN_SRC java
         i = 0;
         while (i < count - 1) {
             a[i] = i;
             a[i + 1] = i + 1;
             i = i + 2
         }

         if (i == count - 1) {
             a[count - 1] = count - 1;
         }
         #+END_SRC
       - In this example the if statement picks up the case that might
         fall through the cracks if =count= is an odd number.
     - *Minimizing the work inside of loops*
       - if you can evaluate statments outside of the loop so that
         only the result is used inside, do that.
     - *Sentinel Values*
       - When you have a loop with a compound test, you can save time
         by simplifying the test.
       - If the loop is a search loop you can use a sentinel value,
         which is a value that you put just past the end of the search
         range that's guaranteed to terminate the search.
     - *Putting the busiest loop on the inside*
     - *Strength Reduction*
       - replacing expensive operations with cheaper operations
       - ex. replace multiplication with addition.
   - *Data Transformations*
     - Changes in data types can reduce program size and improve
       speed.
     - Integers operations tend to be faster than floating points.
     - Use the fewest array dimensions possible
     - Minimize array references
     - Use supplementary indexes
       - add related data that makes accessing a data type more
         efficient.
   - *Memoization*
     - a technique for storing values of a function instead of
       recomputing them each time the function is called.
   - *Expressions*
     - algebraic identities can be used to replace costly operations
       with cheaper ones.
       - Replace multiplication with additions
       - Replace exponentiation with multiplication
       - Replace trig routines with trig identities
       - Replace floating-point numbers with ints
       - etc.
** TODO code smells and refactoring
   - *Refactoring*
     - a technique for cleaning up code in a more efficient and
       controlled manner
     - *Purposes*
       - to improve the design of software
       - to make software easier to understand
       - to help find bugs
       - to help you program faster
     - *When to refactor*
       - when you add function
       - when you need to fix a bug
       - as you do a code review
   - *Code Smells*
     - *Duplicated Code*
       - /Extract Method, Extract Class/
     - *Long Method*
       - /Extract Method/
     - *Large Class*
       - /Extract Class, Extract Subclass/
     - *Long Parameter List*
       - /Replace Parameter with Method/
         - when you can get the data in one parameter by making a
           request of an object that you already know about.
       - /Preserve Whole Object/
         - to take a bunch of data gleaned form an object and replace
           it with the object itself.
       - /Introduce Parameter Object/
         - to group several data items into a logical object
     - *Divergent Change*
       - when one class is commonly changed in different ways for
         different reasons.
       - "Well, I will have to change these methods every time I get a
         new database..."
       - Identify everything that changes for a particular case and
         use /Extract Class/ to put them all together.
     - *Shotgun Surgery*
       - opposite of divergent change.
       - when every time you make a kind of change, you have to make a
         lot of little changes to a lot of different classes.
       - Use /Move Method/ and /Move Field/ to put all of the changes
         into a single class.
       - Often you can use /Inline Class/ to bring a bunch of behavior
         together
       - This may result in Divergent Change
     - *Feature Envy*
       - a method that seems more interested in a class other than the
         one it actually is in.
       - use /Move Method/ to move the method to where it should be
       - sometimes only part of the method suffers from envy, so use
         /Extract Method/ then /Move Method/ to give it a better home.
     - *Data Clumps*
       - bunches of data that hang around together should be made into
         their own object.
       - use /Extract Class/ on the fields to turn these clumps into
         classes.
       - use /Introduce Parameter Object/ or /Preserve Whole Object/
         to slim them down.
     - *Primitive Obsession*
       - using too many primitive types rather than records
       - use /Replace Data Value with Object/
     - *Switch Statements*
       - consider polymorphism
       - use /Extract Method/ to extract the switch statement and then
         /Move Method/ to get it onto the class where the polymorphism
         is needed.
       - then either /Replace Type Code with Subclasses/ or /Replace
         Type Code with State or Strategy/
       - then /Replace Conditional with Polymorphism/
     - *Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies*
       - special case of shotgun surgery
       - happens when every time you make a subclass of one class, you
         have to make a subclass of another.
       - use /Move Method/ and /Move Field/
     - *Lazy Class*
       - a class that isn't doing enough to pay for its existence
         should be eliminated.
       - use /Collapse Hierarchy/ or /Inline Class/
     - *Speculative Generality*
       - when speculative hooks and features are added that aren't
         necessary yet.
       - to get rid of abstract classes use /Collapse Hierarchy/
       - unnescessary delegation can be removed with /Inline Class/
       - Methods with unused params should be handled with /Remove
         Parameter/
       - Methods with odd abstract names should be handled with
         /Rename Method/
     - *Temporary Field*
       - when an instance variable is set only in certain circumstances
       - use /Extract Class/ to create a home for the orphan variables
     - *Message Chains*
       - when a client asks one object for another object, which the
         client then asks for yet another object, etc.
       - use /Hide Delegate/
     - *Middle Man*
       - when too many class methods are delegating tasks to another
         class
       - use /Remove Middle Man/
     - *Inappropriate Intimacy*
       - when classes delve into other classes private data
       - use /Move Method/ and /Move Field/
     - *Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces*
       - use /Rename Method/ on any methods that do the same thing but
         have different signatures for what they do.
     - *Incomplete Library Class*
       - use /Introduce Foreign Method/ to add methods you wish the
         library class had
       - use /Introduce Local Extension/ if there are many of these
         methods.
     - *Data Class*
       - Classes that have fields, getters and setters, and nothing
         else
       - use /Encapsulate Field/
     - *Refused Bequest*
       - when subclasses don't need all/most of the methods and data of
         their parents
       - use /Push Down Method/ and /Push Down Field/ to push all the
         unused methods to the sibling.
     - *Comments*
       - when thick comments are an indicator of bad code
       - when you need a comment to explain what a block of code does,
         try /Extract Method/
